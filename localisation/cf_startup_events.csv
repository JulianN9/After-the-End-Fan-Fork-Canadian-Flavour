castarttitle.2;Tsaa's Last Testament;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.2;After a long and succesful life, [Root.GetTitledName] lies on his deathbed. The first haida King of Vancovuer since the divergence of the twin kingdoms, Tsaa has had to fend off both pagans to the east and south. However, Tsaa's son and chosen heir Skaaxwad has died, leaving you with a difficult decision.\n \n Your second son, Hluuwee, has no ambition to unite with the true Haida to the north. He speaks of embracing the old local Coast salish culture, to apease the natives, even embracing the Cancuks. Some even claim that he has no interest in the fairer sex, and could never produce an heir. He surely would lead the realm to collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.2;Perhaps my grandson Gidansda could rule?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castartdesc.3;Gidansda is the son of Skaaxwad, and shares his ambition. He despises the heathenous canucks wiht their hockey worhips. He speaks of the permanent unification of the haida people under one Haida empire. However, he holds no legal right to inherit the kingdom of Januug Tlagaang, and to do so would surely upset the nobles of the realm.\n \n It is up to Tsaa who will lead Januug Tlagaang into the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.3;Regardless of law, Gidansda shall unite the Haida!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.3;Law must prevail, and perhaps Hluuwee is more competant than he seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.4;The Ascension of Hluuwee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.4;With your inehritence of the throne of Januug Tlagaang, you have begun the process of encouraging the ancient cultures of the Coast Salish. Said to inhabit the land from Vancouver island to Lincoln before the Haida and Canuck, encouraging this identity would help seperate the kindgom from our nothern haida Neighbours. Many of your vassals who were nominally haida, but already praticed their own local cultures, have been happy to take on these new identities. Perhaps this is due to a genuine new identity, or perhaps it is an attempt to distance themselves from the more violent haida to the north. These new Coast salish vassals are petitioning me to push further south and reclaim there ancient land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.4;The oppression of the Coast Salish is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.6;Birds of a Feather;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.6;With the birth of the new, more tolerant culture, I have finally been able to embrace my sexuality. Now, I have accomplished something no Haida ruler ever could by marrying a man. In a magnificant ceremony in the floral gorund of Victoria I was wed. Many of my subjects rejoiced, but some were not so happy. Chief among them is Gidansda, my cousin, who sent an envoy who claims that if I were to adopt a child he would no longer recognize me as the true King of Januug Tlagaang. He has many supporters of the haida who oppose the changes, and perhaps it is best not to provoke them. Though without an heir it is unclear how much the current reforms will continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.6;I will adopt a son and continue my legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.6;Perhaps Gidansda is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.7;A Step Too Far;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.7;Your imputent uncle King Hluuwee has adopted a son, taking you out of direct succesion. This, combined with his reforms and abandonement of the haida culture is a step too far. Already many staunch Haida have gathered to my court, begging me to take the throne of Haida Tlagaang. Soon it will be time to retake the rightful place of the haida. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.7;All the coast shall be Haida!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.8;Stirring to the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.8;After the death of Tsaa, a powerstruggle has consumed the kingdom of Vancouver to the West. Now, following the persecution of canucks and rinkites alike, many peasents and nobles have fled to my court. They are pleading your me to retake my possesions and secure them a home free of persecution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.8;We will strike when the time is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.9;The Haida Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.9;After hearing my decision to adopt a child, many diehard Haida warriors have flocked to my jealous nephew Gidansda. Emboldened, he has declared war demanding I resign. Even worse, whsipers from the east tell of the return of the canucks, whising to reclaim their ancient land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.9;Oh bother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.10;An opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.10;The war to the west has begun, and now is the perfect time to strike. If I do not push our claim for Vancouver now it is unlikely anyone will recognize it in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.10;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.10;Perhaps this isn't such a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.11;Resurgence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.11;Though my apppointement by my father was controversial, most Haida nobles have supported me because of the questionable views of my uncle. This support is conditional, however, onmy atttempt to reunify the haida world. Failing to do so would surely anger my existing supporters, but it is a daunting task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.11;We will march north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.11;Perhaps this isn't such a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.12;Stirring to the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.12;It is not long since the Kingdom of Januug Tlagaang broke away from the authority of Haida Tlagaang, and many of my nobles have been asking for the reunification. However, the impudent Gidansda of Januug Tlagaang has the gaul to claim Haida Tlagaang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.12;We have other things to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.12;We will take back Haida Tlagaang by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.13;Haida Tlagaang Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.13;The cowards in Haida Tlagaang have not responded to my claims to their territory. This is a great boon in prestige, and now would the perfect time to strike north. If we fail to do so it would be a great hit in prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.13;What are we waiting for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.13;We have other things to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.16;The Haida Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.16;Following the reunifications of the kingdoms of Januug Tlagaang and Haida Tlagaang, [Root.GetTitled.Name] has been procalimed emperor of all Haida people and protector of the peoples of the coast. This surely marks the begining of an era of Haida dominance in the northwest, as the neighbours look on in fear of the mighty raiding fleets being assembled. Perhaps this empire will be strong enough to challenge the Cetic dominance, only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.16;The entire coast will heed my will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptB.16;The Raven's wings will cover the coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptC.16;Distrubing news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptD.16;We will reclaim the Canadian land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.21;An Odd Job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.21;Today is a wonderful day, I have nothing to do, and my wife Morley is gone for the day. Perhaps I should build that statue to the coach at his berial ground. I've never had any building experience, but I've got a mallet, chisel and a big rock and I'm sure I get get it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.21;Just a hole here and there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.22;Some helping hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.22;After a few hours I've simply accomplish making several large holes in the boulder. A couple of my courtiers have walked by and have begun to offer me help. It seems like destruction is very attractive, and already there are upwards of 10 burly men bashing holes into this boulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.22;This will be done in no time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.23;A bit overboard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.23;We are now several hour into our work and the project is expanding without bound. In trying to fix the boulder, we have only created more of a mess. Some of my courtiers have started on a structure to house the future statue, others have begun to collect what they believe to be the coach's favorite things. However, in the center of it all sits a sad lump of rock that once was a boulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.23;I hope I don't have to pay for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.24;Morley's return;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.24;As the day draws to a close, Morely returns to the castle to find no one home. A courtier leads her outside to the mess we have created. She is awestruck by the amount of labourers who stand besides me. She calls out: "who will pay for this", and this cauchophony of sound sends a shockwave to the shaky constructions around me. A rock tumbles down, then a beam, and just as fast as the temple surrounding the boulder came up it tumbles down. Now even more furious, Morley orders all of the workers away, and demands that a proper temple being constructed immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.24;Oh dear..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

castarttitle.25;Two steps forward ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartdesc.25;After a couple of arduous months an actual rink has been created tot honour the coach. A beautiful structure, it is filled with many scraps of the garments said to be worn by him. Their mistical colours and patterns attract many a peasent from far and wide. It looks at last that things are returning to normal. As I take Morley for a walk around the rink we stare at the entrance together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
castartoptA.25;Wouldn't a statue look nice here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
