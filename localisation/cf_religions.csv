dominionist_DESC;Dominionists get their name from the belief that all of old Canada was the holy "Dominion" of The Queen. The Queen from a heavenly land to the east and would appoint a Govenor General to act as both her messenger and as the primary means to enforce her will. However, each province of the mighty empire would have their own Lieutenant Govenor to arbitrate local disputes. They hold that Canada was a unique entity due to the Queens continued dominion and that the scourge which was ancient America was responsible for the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

They go against the previously dominant view in Dominionist theology by proclaiming the Prime Minister's as not merely secular leader, but as religious leaders and gods in their own right; with the Lyon being chief among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

Eschewing ideas of Queen or Prime Minister, they believe that the popular game of hockey is not just a passtime but a way of life, a game emulating how the gods wage an eternal war against the forces of evil. Rinkites believe that by playing hockey they gave their gods the strength to continue their fight. Furthermore, mortals of particular skill will be summoned to play for the gods upon their death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

Certain influential groups within Canadian society seemed to worship the Queen and the Cross, while documents show the atartling similarities to a Canadian "charter" and the Americain "constitution". As such the trinity of the the Lady Liberty, Mother Mary, and the Queen has become ver popular amond the Dominionist community. While all considered different manifestations of one god, followers tend to favour one above the others.

There is now a consensus among the Dominionist community that efforts should be taken to reclaim what is rightfully theirs, and that Canada should once more cover such a territory. It is the destiny of Canada to stretch from sea ot sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
