domdescA.24;The Great and Noble Prophet is dead! From his teaching the Dominionist faith has been returned to its rightful place in Canada. May he rest easy in the East! \n Many are proclaiming him the reincarnation of the ancient prime ministers. This has begun a great theological split in the Dominionist community! A section of followers have begun preaching that on his deathbed, the prophet not only died but ascended to godhood. This goes against established Dominionist doctrine that the Prime Minister is merely a messenger for the Queen, not truly divine. Many leaders within the Dominionist community including the prophets appointed successor, have already condemned this line of thinking, but despite that it is still becoming increasingly popular. \n Already many peasents are rejecting the authority of the Dominionists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

domtitle.26;Dominionist Hegemony Shatters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
domdescA.26;The theological split in the Dominionist faith has begun to rapidly spiral out of control. Fights are breaking out between families, friends, and even within of the priesthood. In order to prevent full on chaos and a complete destruction of this young community the current Prime Minister has convened a council between the great theological minds on both sides in order to try and solve this. \n Days into the council it appears to be going well and that orthodox Dominionist views are gaining the upper hand. However just as it seems the final supporters of the heretical view are going to switch sides, a late delegation bursts through the doors. With them is a young man, who begins to reveal pre-event documents speaking of a man known as "The Lion", who successfully fought against the power of the Queen and the terror of the Governor General. Not only did this man fight against the Queen, records also show he was a Prime Minister, with that revelation murmurs of discontent begin among the crowd.\n Chaos is the only word that can describe the council floor, fights break out regularly and order has broken down to the point that the theological arguments of guardsmen are being seriously considered. All sides have begun to radicalize, Dominionists have begun to downplay the importance of the individual Prime Minister while the so called "Lyonites" have begun to deny the divinity of the Queen all together, proposing that not only is the prophet divine but that the prime ministers are the true gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
